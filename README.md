# user-directory
  1. create a member directory that is filterable for research field, sub skill and user name. The directory itself will show the name,research field,sub skill, email (with no hyperlink to anything).
  
  2.  We will use bootstrap to put the filter on top - we will then use the selectize.js.

  3. In the profile application: when the user adds new subskill and saves it - each sub skill is added to a sub skill list.
  
  4. When another user trying to add sub skill a auto complete suggestion pops up with the sub skill list  in the selectize.js style.

  5. We will make a connection map in d3.js of the sub skill list and the users connected to every sub skill.
