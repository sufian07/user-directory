# user-directory
- create a member directory that is filterable for research field, skill and user name. The directory itself will show the name,research field, skill, email (with no hyperlink to anything).
- In the profile application: when the user adds new skill and saves it - each skill is added to a skill list.
- When another user trying to add skill a auto complete suggestion pops up with the skill list  in the selectize.js style.
- We will make a connection map in d3.js of the skill list and the users connected to every sub skill.
